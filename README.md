<h1 style="border-bottom: 0;"> Odin Final Project: Calculator </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<ul>
    <li> Create a calculator using everything I learned from Odin Project's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course. </li>
    <li> Calculator can do basic mathematical functions. </li>
    <li> Events are either "click" or "keydown". </li>
    <li> Include validations to prevent errors. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Known Issues </h2>
<ul>
    <li> When clicking on a button's text, it doesn't trigger it's "click" event. User must click anywhere within the button as long as it's not the button's text. </li>
</ul>
